This repository contains my solutions to the Daily Coding Challenge. Each day, I complete one coding task, document my approach, and push the solution here.

Household Energy Consumption — Summary Report(DAY 1)

Key Statistics
• Average Electricity Usage: 301.34 kWh
• Average Gas Usage: 123.26 units
• Average Monthly Income: ₹59,793
• Average Family Size: 4.1 members
• Average Appliances Count: 7.9
• 90th Percentile Electricity: ≥ 470 kWh
• 90th Percentile Gas: ≥ 183 units

Insights
1. Family Size: Larger families (6–7) use slightly more gas, but electricity usage does not rise linearly.
2. Appliances: Households with 7+ appliances show higher electricity usage (~340 kWh).
3. Income: Medium-income households consume most electricity (~308 kWh), while high-income use
more gas (~128 units).
4. High Consumers (Top 10%):
• Electricity ≥ 470 kWh
• Gas ≥ 183 units
• Typically large families with 10+ appliances

 Key Insights

Electricity drives peak demand while gas usage remains steady year-round.
Old appliances consume more energy than multiple modern devices.
Smaller households use more per person compared to larger families.
High and low-income homes both consume heavily — lifestyle vs. inefficiency.

 Recommendations

Promote appliance upgrades with rebates to replace outdated devices.
Roll out smart meters for real-time energy monitoring and control.
Encourage rooftop solar adoption with targeted subsidies.
Support low-income families through free LED kits and efficiency loans.
